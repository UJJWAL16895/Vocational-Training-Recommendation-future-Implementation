# Vocational Training Recommendation System

This application recommends vocational training programs based on regional employment data using machine learning algorithms.

## Project Overview

This final year ML project aims to bridge the gap between job market demands and vocational training by analyzing regional employment data and recommending suitable training programs to users based on their preferences, background, and market trends.

## Features

- Data collection and preprocessing of regional employment statistics
- Machine learning models to identify employment trends and skill gaps
- Personalized recommendation system for vocational training programs
- User-friendly web interface for input and recommendations
- Visualization of job market trends and opportunities
